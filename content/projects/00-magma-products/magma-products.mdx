![react logo with with an illustration of a content management system user interface](images/react-cms.png)

### React

I built a custom React CMS for editing product data. You can find a [simplified demo in my codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/lunajuan/cms-react-demo). Some features include:  undo history, rich-text editing with **Draft.js**, form management with **Formik**, validations with **Yup**, and theme switching with **styled-components**.

</div>

### SASS
On the public site, I used SASS to construct modular CSS components with the **BEM** methodology and a sprinkle of *atomic* styles.

</div>

<div className="grid-item">

### JS
Webpack bundles all client-side code from **ES6** to ES5, including polyfills for important features like Promises.

![mongodb name with and illustration of network lines with leaves growing on it](images/mongodb.png)

### MonogoDB

I deployed over 900 products, each with their own set of images, pdf documents and relations to each other. Some products belonged to a single record, as in the case of variant products, and some belonged to many, as in the case of accessories and replacement parts.

</div>

<div className="grid-item">

![diagram of node application connecting with snipcart and local database](images/snipcart-integration.png)

### Snipcart

I create a custom cart flows through their public API. I used their REST API to update Magma Products' internal inventory systems.

</div>

<div className="grid-item">

![diagram of node application connecting with shipping carriers and snipcart](images/shipping-integration.png)

### Shipping Rates

Generate custom shipping rate calculations enabled by Snipcart's shipping **Webhook**. Requested data from FedEx (*XML SOAP API*), UPS(*JSON API*), and USPS(*XML API*) to generate custom shipping rate calculations based on the type of products in the cart.

</div>

<div className="grid-item">

![diagram of node application connecting with Shipworks and Snipcart](images/shipworks-integration.png)

### Shipworks

I built a custom integration between Snipcart and Shipworks to manage the shipment of online orders.
